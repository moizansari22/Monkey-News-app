        Privacy Policy
    </h1>
    <h3 >
        A. Introduction
    </h3>
  
  
    <p >
        We are committed to protecting your privacy. We ask that you please read
        the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding
        your personal data and how we, as data controller of your personal data,
        will treat it.
    </p>
    <p >
        We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully (in
        accordance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2010 in the Malaysia).
    </p>
    <h3 >
        B. The Information: We Collect Big Data
    </h3>
    <p >
        <strong>Data we collect from you directly</strong>
    </p>
    <p >
        When you register to use our App, we will ask for the following
        information: your name, email address, password, IP address and postcode.
        We may also ask you to provide your age, your phone number, your address
        and possibly certain other personal details such as gender or where you
        heard about us.
    </p>
    <p >
        In addition, you will be able to register for the third-party website of a
        retailer via Wizideals. We may use such information if you insert any
        information in such third party registration form, in accordance with this
        Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p >
        In addition, from time to time we will run surveys of our users so we can
        learn more about consumer behaviour in general and our users in particular.
        You might be invited to participate. Such participation is always voluntary
        and it will always be clear from the invitation that this is a voluntary
        survey, and not information that is required to be provided in order to use
        our App. If you do participate, any data provided will be used in
        accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p >
        <strong>Data we collect from your activity on the App</strong>
  
    </p>
    <p>
      As you use the App and personalise your account, we collect data about your
      activity on the App. This includes things like:
    </p>
    <p >
        • Your communications with Wizideals;
        
        • Information about your current location (for users of Wizideals
        App). You may opt out of having this data collected at any time by managing
        your smartphone location services settings;
        
        • Other Information related to your use of the Services;
        
        • Other information related to your activity, such as which website
        referred you to us;
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Data we collect from other sources</strong>
    </p>
    <p >
        We may receive information about you from third party sources, such as data
        aggregators and from third parties to whom you have given permission to
        share your information or from whom you have given us permission to request
        your information. For instance, by registering for the App using Facebook
        or another social network, you grant permission to that network to share
        your details. Depending on the network rules and your settings on it, this
        may include data such as your date of birth, your marital status, the
        number of people in your household and other information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sensitive Personal Data</strong>
    </p>
    <p >
        Sensitive personal data is defined by the Personal Data Protection Act 2010
        and includes details such as information related to your health, sexual
        orientation, religion, race or ethnic origin. For the most part, we will
        not need any Sensitive Personal Data in order to provide our services and
        we will not request it. However, we may be able to assume sensitive
        personal data about you from the information you provide. By letting us
        have any sensitive personal data, you expressly consent to us using and
        telling others about any of your sensitive personal data so we can provide
        you with the goods or services requested by you and engage in commercial
        activities in the way set out in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <h3 >
        C. How We Use the Information We Collect
    </h3>
    <p >
        We use the personal data we collect to provide the Services, to customise
        and improve your Wizideals experience, to make your experience as
        enjoyable and efficient as possible and for commercial purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Use of Information to Provide the Services</strong>
    </p>
    <p >
        Certain information is required in order for the Services, or certain
        features of the Services, to operate e.g. we use your IP address to prevent
        any spam, fraud or abuse of our site.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Use of Information to Customise and Improve the Wizideals Experience</strong>
    </p>
    <p >
        We want your price comparison experience on Wizideals to be as enjoyable
        as possible. We will collect the data about your browsing activities and
        preferences to customise your account (in addition to how you customise it
        yourself) and to enable us to provide an efficient and user-friendly
        service. We will also use it to improve the quality of the App.
    </p>
    <p >
        Here are some specific examples of how we use your data:
    </p>
    <p  >
        • Paying attention to how you use the App help us to develop
        improvements to the App and the Services.
        
        
        • If you have been referred to us by a third-party website, we may
        keep a record of the website that referred you so that we may work out
        which websites refer more or less users to our App. We may also have
        referral arrangements with certain third-party websites and referrers and
        we may use this data to fulfil obligations that we may have to these
        third-party websites or referrers.
        
        
        • We collect and track individual and aggregate information about
        shopping habits, products and service preferences and selections which
        users have made and the like. We use this information for the
        personalisation or general improvement of the Services, but also for the
        purpose of business research. You can see more about aggregate information
        below.
        
        
        • We collect and track individual and aggregate connection
        information such as browser type and version, operating system and
        platform; other software and hardware information and the like. We use this
        information to understand how and when our users access our services, and
        so we can further develop our App and Services to suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Use of Information for Commercial Purposes</strong>
    </p>
    <p >
        Wizideals does not charge non-commercial users for use of the App. In
        terms of data which is personal to you however, we earn revenues from this
        (which allows us to keep the App updated and totally free to our
        non-commercial users) through industry standard sources and methods
        including advertising sales which may be targeted to you (including online
        behavioural advertising, including and personalised retargeting
        advertising, ) and through the sale of business intelligence data (which is
        anonymised).
    </p>
    <p >
        Here is how your information is used for this:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li >
            <p >
                We use information about your activity on our App, including
                information about your current location when using the App, in
                order to present you with targeted advertising-that is, product
                information, offers and promotions that we think may be interesting
                to you and that you might like. Without targeting, you will still
                see advertisements; they are just less likely to be relevant.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li >
            <p >
                We share information with certain carefully selected third party
                partners so that they can:
        
        
            </p>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li >
                <p >
                    Present you with advertisements and promotional offers that are
                    relevant to you and your interests on both Wizideals and other
                    sites based on your activity on Wizideals or, alternatively;
                </p>
            </li>
        
            <li >
                <p >
                    To present you with advertisements on Wizideals based on your
                    activity on other websites. For example, you may see ads for
                    products you viewed on another website while browsing
                    Wizideals.
                    
                    
                    For more information on data sharing, please see the "Data
                    Sharing" section.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    
  
        <li >
            <p >
                We collect and may display or use for the purposes of marketing and
                advertising the App, Services or ourselves, any testimonials you
                provide us with about the App, the Services or ourselves - and we
                may append to the testimonial your first name (but not your
                surname) and general geographic location (e.g. City or locale).
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>	Use of Your Email Address</strong>
    </p>
    <p >
        We use your email address to communicate with you. Some of these are
        service emails and are so we can communicate with you about App updates or
        your activity on the App. For instance, we may send you service emails:
  
      </p><p >
        • to send you information which you have asked for; and
          
          • to contact you about the status of ratings or reviews you have
          submitted using our Services.
      </p>
  
    <p></p>
    <p >
        In addition, from time to time we may email you marketing emails with App
        news and updates or details of sales offers or promotions. These may be
        marketing for the App itself or on behalf of third parties. We may also
        contact you for market research purposes, either for commercial purposes or
        so we can get feedback about the App.
    </p>
    <p >
        Your acceptance of the Wizideals Terms of Use means that you are giving us
        consent to send you these emails. However, you can easily opt out of
        receiving marketing emails by clicking "unsubscribe" in the relevant email
        or by updating your email preferences in the "My Account" section of the
        App at any time. Even if you opt out, we will still send you service emails
        about the App itself, your account and your activities on the App.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Aggregate Information</strong>
    </p>
    <p >
        Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of
        products, services or users, from which individual user identities have
        been removed and from which it is not possible to work out individual
        customer identities. In other words, information about how you use a
        service may be collected and combined with information about how others use
        the same service, but all such information will be anonymised and no
        identifying information will be included in the resulting data.
    </p>
    <p >
        Aggregate data helps us to understand trends and customer needs so that new
        products and services can be considered and so that existing products and
        services can be tailored to customer desires. We use and disclose
        anonymised aggregate information to provide other products and services, as
        well for the purposes of evaluating and improving our existing products and
        services. We also sell such aggregate information through other channels.
    </p>
    <h3 >
        D. Security Measures
    </h3>
    <p >
        All of the information we collect about you is stored on our secure servers
        and will be held securely in accordance with our internal security policy
        and the law. For example, we use secure encryption to hold passwords (e.g.
        the password allocated as part of the registration process - which may
        later be changed) or your login details for a Supermarket (if you authorise
        us to save this information).
    </p>
    <p >
        We may send your information internationally including to countries. While
        we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is
        treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, some places
        outside of Malaysia may not have adequate data protection laws at all or
        may offer differing levels of protection of personal information which are
        not as high as in the Malaysia. By submitting your data to us, you
        acknowledge that provided we have used your data in the ways set out in
        this Privacy Policy, we cannot be held responsible for any use of your data
        by third parties who receive and process your data.
    </p>
    <p >
        Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not
        completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
        data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our App;
        any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your
        information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to
        prevent unauthorised access.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Operating Purposes</strong>

        operation of the App. These companies receive only the personal information
        required in order to provide services, and are not allowed to use that
        information for anything aside from providing the services.
        
        
        • We reserve the right to investigate suspected violations of the
        Terms of Use of the App or illegal, fraudulent or inappropriate behaviour
        on the App; and to engage in activities needed to protect the rights,
        property, or safety of ourselves, of our users, or of others. To that end,
        and to the extent necessary to achieve the forgoing, we may exchange
        information with other companies and organisations, including but not
        limited to Supermarkets, our affiliates and partners and law enforcement
        agencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Corporate and Statutory Purposes</strong>
    </p>
  
    <p  >
        • We may transfer our databases containing your personal information
        if we sell our business or part of it and engage in another similar
        corporate transaction.
        
        
        • We will share personal information where we are required to share
        your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Modification of the Privacy Policy</strong>

        Wizideals reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy anytime without
        prior notice. You are responsible for regularly viewing of this Privacy
        Policy. Should you continue to use Wizideals app, it shall be deemed that
        you provide consent to such changes.
